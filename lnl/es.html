    <h2>Slides</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>TODO</li>
      <li>Events slide:  Events happen in the past.</li>
      <li>Events slide:  Events are immutable. Because events happen in the past, they cannot be changed or undone. However, subsequent events may alter or negate the effects of earlier events.</li>
      <li>Events slide:  Events are one-way messages. Events have a single source (publisher) that publishes the event. One or more recipients (subscribers) may receive events.</li>
      <li>Events slide:  Typically, events include parameters that provide additional information about the event.</li>
      <li>Events slide:  In the context of event sourcing, events should describe business intent.</li>
      <li>A stream is an unbounded sequence of records.</li>
      <li>Group Event-Sourcing Activity</li>
      <li>Slide showing difference between event-driven and API driven.  (See New York Times research for diagrams.)</li>
      <li>When creating an application using event sourcing, you need a store for the log of changes.  Kafka has already solved problems:  Immutable log, Computing "materialized views" off of the log.  (The New York Times does this...) 
      <li>Tradeoffs</li>
